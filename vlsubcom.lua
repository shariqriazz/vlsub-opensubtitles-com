VLSub OpenSubtitles.com Extension for VLC Media Player 3.0+
================================================================================

DESCRIPTION:
A modern VLC extension for downloading subtitles from OpenSubtitles.com using
their latest REST API v2. This extension provides smart search capabilities,
multi-language support, automatic metadata detection, and enhanced performance
compared to legacy XML-RPC based extensions.

FEATURES:
- 🔍 Smart Search: Hash-based + name-based search with GuessIt integration
- 🌐 Multi-language Support: Up to 3 preferred languages with prioritization
- 🎯 Auto-detection: System locale, timezone, and IP geolocation detection
- 📱 Modern API: OpenSubtitles.com REST API v2 for better performance
- 🔄 Auto-updates: Built-in update mechanism
- 🎬 Smart Metadata: GuessIt API integration for movie/TV show detection
- 🏆 Quality Indicators: Trusted uploaders, download counts, sync quality
- 💾 Flexible Download: Auto-load or manual save with language codes
- 🌍 Country-specific: Intelligent language suggestions

REQUIREMENTS:
- VLC Media Player 3.0 or newer
- OpenSubtitles.com account (free registration required)
- Internet connection for searching and downloading
- curl command-line tool (for downloads - usually pre-installed)

INSTALLATION:
Quick Install (Recommended):
  macOS/Linux: curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opensubtitles/vlsub-opensubtitles-com/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
  Windows: iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opensubtitles/vlsub-opensubtitles-com/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex

Manual Install:
1. Download vlsubcom.lua from: https://github.com/opensubtitles/vlsub-opensubtitles-com/releases
2. Copy to VLC extensions directory:
   - Windows: %APPDATA%\vlc\lua\extensions\
   - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/org.videolan.vlc/lua/extensions/
   - Linux: ~/.local/share/vlc/lua/extensions/
3. Restart VLC Media Player
4. Access via VLC → Extensions → VLSub OpenSubtitles.com

USAGE:
1. Setup: Open VLC → VLC → Extensions → VLSub OpenSubtitles.com → Config
2. Login: Enter your OpenSubtitles.com username and password
3. Play: Start your video file
4. Search: Click "🎯 Search by Hash" or "🔍 Search by Name"
5. Download: Double-click any subtitle to download and load automatically

SUPPORTED LANGUAGES:
100+ languages including major languages (English, Spanish, French, German,
Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean), regional variants,
and all EU languages.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

      Download subtitles from
      <a href='http://www.opensubtitles.org/'>
      opensubtitles.org
      </a> and display them while watching a video.<br>
      <br>
      <b><u>Usage:</u></b><br>
      <br>
      Start your video. If you use Vlsub witout playing a video
      you will get a link to download the subtitles in your browser
      but the subtitles won't be saved and loaded automatically.<br>
      <br>
      Choose up to 3 languages for your subtitles and click on the
      button corresponding to one of the two research methods
      provided by VLSub:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 1: Search by hash</b><br>
      It is recommended to try this method first, because it
      performs a research based on the video file print, so you
      can find subtitles synchronized with your video.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 2: Search</b><br>
      If you have no luck with the first method, just check the
      title is correct before clicking. If you search subtitles
      for a series, you can also provide a season and episode
      number.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Downloading Subtitles</b><br>
      Select one subtitle in the list and click on 'Download'.<br>
      It will be put in the same directory that your video, with
      the same name (different extension)
      so VLC will load them automatically the next time you'll
      start the video.<br>
      <br>
      <b>/!\\ Beware :</b> Existing subtitles are overwritten
      without asking confirmation, so put them elsewhere if
      they're important.<br>

-- VLC HTTP Client - Protocol-based method selection
-- =============================================================================
-- VLC HTTP Client Implementation
-- =============================================================================
-- This HTTP client implementation compares to bettervlsub.lua as follows:
--
-- DIFFERENCES FROM BETTERVSUB.LUA:
-- 1. Separate class-based structure (VLCHttpClient) vs inline functions
-- 2. Dual-mode operation: HTTPS uses vlc.stream, HTTP uses vlc.net.connect_tcp
--    - bettervlsub: Always uses vlc.net.connect_tcp (with optional SSL fallback)
--    - This version: Chooses best method based on protocol
-- 3. URL parameter sorting for OpenSubtitles.com API compatibility
--    - bettervlsub: No parameter sorting
--    - This version: Alphabetically sorts URL params (API requirement)
-- 4. Custom chunked transfer encoding decoder
--    - bettervlsub: Has parse_chunked() function (lines 2324-2375)
--    - This version: Has decode_chunked_body() function (lines 8318-8399)
-- 5. Response body cleaning (removes artifacts, extracts JSON)
--    - bettervlub: No explicit cleaning
--    - This version: clean_response_body() function (lines 8403-8461)
-- 6. Timeout/retry configuration per-client
--    - bettervlsub: Global timeout settings
--    - This version: Per-client timeout/retry settings
-- 7. Header management through add_header() method
--    - bettervlsub: Headers built inline in get() function (lines 2230-2237)
--    - This version: Stored in self.headers table
-- 8. Progress tracking during download
--    - bettervlsub: Updates UI with percentage in http_req_once()
--    - This version: No progress tracking in HTTP layer
-- 9. Authentication (Bearer tokens)
--    - bettervlsub: No explicit auth support
--    - This version: Full JWT token support via Authorization header
-- 10. URL encoding differences
--     - bettervlsub: Uses vlc.strings.encode_uri_component()
--     - This version: Custom url_encode() using + for spaces (API preference)
--
-- SIMILARITIES:
-- - Both use vlc.net.connect_tcp for HTTP requests
-- - Both use vlc.net.poll() for non-blocking I/O
-- - Both handle chunked transfer encoding
-- - Both implement retry logic with delays
-- - Both parse HTTP response headers manually
-- - Both support vlc.net.connect_ssl if available for HTTPS
